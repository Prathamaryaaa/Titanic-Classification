# Titanic Classification
This project aims to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning classification techniques. Given various attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their name, age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. The dataset is split into training and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic-Classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Titanic-Classification
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions:

```bash
jupyter notebook Titanic_Classification.ipynb
```
or

```bash
python Titanic_Classification.py
```

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that contribute most to predicting survival status.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate classification algorithms and train them on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics and validate them using cross-validation techniques.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the models by optimizing their hyperparameters to improve performance.
7. **Prediction**: Make predictions on the test data using the trained models.
8. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the predictions and assess the model's performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
## Results

The results of the classification models are summarized in the project report or notebook. The performance metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of each model in predicting survival status.
